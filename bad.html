    You must be wondering why you're here right?<br>
    I'll tell you why:<br>
    You clicked "No" when you were asked to play again! (There is a 1 in 20 chance of this happening when "No" is clicked)<br>
    <b>YOU WILL NEVER ESCAPE CUBESHOOT!!!</b><br>
    I bet you must also feel bored at the fact that your FAVORITE game is now unavailable to you at this moment right?<br>
    Never fear!<br>
    I am a forgiving lord.<br>
    Instead of Cube Shoot, would you like to try some Reddit 50/50?<br>
    Or rather: Cube Shoot 50/50?<br>
    <b>HAHHAHAHAH!!!</b>

    Now you are very.....<br>

    um...<br>

    defeated?<br>

    i really don't know...<br>

    Here's something else you can do!<br>

    -Think about whether this game is "Cube Shoot" or "Cubeshoot"<br>

    maybe it's even "CubeShoot"<br>

    Who Knows!?<br>
    
    The real question is: How do I get out of here?<br>
    -The answer is simple: Wait 5 minutes to repent your sins.<br>
